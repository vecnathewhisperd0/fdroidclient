/**
 * This class has helper methods for preparing apks for installation.
 * <p/>
 * APK handling for installations:
 * 1. APKs are downloaded into a cache directory that is either created on SD card
 * <i>"/Android/data/[app_package_name]/cache/apks"</i> (if card is mounted and app has
 * appropriate permission) or on device's file system depending incoming parameters.
 * 2. Before installation, the APK is copied into the private data directory of the F-Droid,
 * <i>"/data/data/[app_package_name]/files/install-$random.apk"</i>.
 * 3. The hash of the file is checked against the expected hash from the repository
 * 4. For Android < 7, a file Uri pointing to the File is returned, for Android >= 7,
 * a content Uri is returned using support lib's FileProvider.
