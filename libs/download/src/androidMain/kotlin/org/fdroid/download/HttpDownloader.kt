     * If the `ETag` does not match, it could be caused by the previous
     * download of the same file coming from a mirror running on a different
     * webserver, e.g. Apache vs Nginx.  `Content-Length` and
     * `Last-Modified` are used to check whether the file has changed since
     * those are more standardized than `ETag`.  Plus, Nginx and Apache 2.4
     * defaults use only those two values to generate the `ETag` anyway.
     * Unfortunately, other webservers and CDNs have totally different methods
     * for generating the `ETag`.  And mirrors that are syncing using a
     * method other than `rsync` could easily have different `Last-Modified`
     * times on the exact same file.  On top of that, some services like GitHub's
     * raw file support `raw.githubusercontent.com` and GitLab's raw file
     * support do not set the `Last-Modified` header at all.  So ultimately,
     * then `ETag` needs to be used first and foremost, then this calculated
     * `ETag` can serve as a common fallback.
     *
     *
     * In order to prevent the `ETag` from being used as a form of tracking
     * cookie, this code never sends the `ETag` to the server.  Instead, it
     * uses a `HEAD` request to get the `ETag` from the server, then
     * only issues a `GET` if the `ETag` has changed.
     *
     *
     * This uses a integer value for `Last-Modified` to avoid enabling the
     * use of that value as some kind of "cookieless cookie".  One second time
     * resolution should be plenty since these files change more on the time
     * space of minutes or hours.
